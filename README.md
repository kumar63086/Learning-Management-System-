###ðŸ§  Problem Solving in Projects â€“ Real Scenarios
ðŸ§© 1. Dynamic Role-Based Access (Student vs Instructor)
ðŸ›‘ Problem:
Clerk provided basic auth, but I needed different dashboards and permissions for students and instructors.

##âœ… Solution:

Used Clerk metadata to store user roles.

On login, created a middleware that checks user role before routing.

Protected instructor-only routes like /create-course using role guards.

ðŸ§  Outcome:
Improved security and gave users a personalized experience based on role.

ðŸ’³ 2. Stripe Webhook Payment Verification
ðŸ›‘ Problem:
Stripe returned success on frontend, but enrollment didnâ€™t update if the backend wasnâ€™t hit correctly.

âœ… Solution:

Created a webhook listener in Express to confirm payments.

On receiving checkout.session.completed, I updated the database with userId and courseId.

Handled async race conditions to prevent duplicate enrollments.

ðŸ§  Outcome:
Achieved 100% reliable payment-to-enrollment flow with backend validation.

ðŸ“¦ 3. Component Reusability and State Overload
ðŸ›‘ Problem:
React components were becoming repetitive, and state was duplicated across pages.

âœ… Solution:

Introduced a shared component library (CourseCard, LessonTile, UserBadge).

Refactored logic into custom hooks like useAuth, useCourses.

Created centralized loading/error UI states.

ðŸ§  Outcome:
Cleaner code, easier debugging, and a maintainable front-end structure.

ðŸ”„ 4. Data Consistency Between Frontend & Backend
ðŸ›‘ Problem:
User data updates (like enrolled courses) werenâ€™t syncing immediately on the UI.

âœ… Solution:

Used React Query/RTK Query for caching and auto-refetching.

Triggered refetch() after mutations like enrollments or course updates.

Also added optimistic UI updates for better experience.

ðŸ§  Outcome:
Data became reactive, UI stayed in sync with real-time backend changes.

ðŸ§¾ 5. Scalability in Front-End Structure
ðŸ›‘ Problem:
As features grew, managing UI logic and API calls became hard.

âœ… Solution:

Shifted to a feature-based folder structure.

Used environment-based config for API endpoints.

Broke large components into logical child components.

ðŸ§  Outcome:
Codebase was easier for team collaboration and scaling.
